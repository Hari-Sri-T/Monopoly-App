# Monopoly Dealings: A Web-Based Game Companion

Monopoly Dealings is a modern, web-based companion app designed to streamline your Monopoly board game sessions. It replaces physical cash and property cards with a real-time, digital interface, allowing one player to act as the banker (Organizer) while others manage their assets from their own devices.

This project leverages Node.js for a secure backend and Google Firebase for real-time data synchronization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd monopoly-event
    ```

2.  **Create a `public` directory:**
    The `server.js` file is configured to serve static files from a `public` folder.
    ```sh
    mkdir public
    ```
    Now, **move the `index.html` file inside the new `public` directory.**

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install Express.js, as defined in `package.json`.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create an Environment Variables file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. This is where you will store your secret keys and password.

5.  **Populate the `.env` file:**
    Add your Firebase project configuration and a secure organizer password to the `.env` file. The server (`server.js`) will use these variables.

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration
    FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
    FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project.appspot.com"
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="123456789"
    FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:12345:web:abcdef"
    FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-ABCDEF"

    # Organizer Password
    ORGANIZER_PASSWORD="a-very-secret-password"

    # Server Port (Optional)
    PORT=10000
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the server:**
    This command executes `server.js` using Node.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Open the app:**
    You should see a confirmation in your terminal: `‚úÖ Server running on 10000`.
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:10000`.
